oursql v0.9.5!
Lightly modified by Justin Graves / Infegy to build on Python 3 with MySQL 8

Comprehensive documentation for oursql is available online:
http://packages.python.org/oursql/

The documentation can also be built locally by running `make html` from the 
'docs' directory (which does require sphinx), or read in their original reST 
format.
